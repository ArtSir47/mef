            <p>You also confirm that you are not authorized to access any aspect of the “MEF.DEV Services” and (or) the “MEF.DEV Platform” in a form of source code.</p>

            <h2>Other People’s Property</h2>
            <p>We respect the intellectual property rights of others. If you have a reason to believe that your copyright is being infringed by any “MEF.DEV Services” and (or) “MEF.DEV Platform” content, please send a written notice of such infringement to <a href="mailto:admin@mef.dev">admin@mef.dev</a>.</p>

            <h2>Price Accuracy and Warranty Disclaimer</h2>
            <p>Your use of the “MEF.DEV Services” and (or) “MEF.DEV Platform” is entirely at your own risk.</p>
            <p>Although we enforce strict price accuracy policy with all partners which provide us information on third party Products, and seek to ensure that the content displayed on the Services and the “MEF.DEV Platform” is relevant and up to date, we cannot guarantee its reliability and accuracy.</p>
            <p>We provide the “MEF.DEV Services” and “Platforms” on an "as it is" basis and categorically refuse to give any warranties and conditions of any kind, either obvious or implied, including but not limited to implied ownership warranties, non-infringement, fitting for a specific purpose and accuracy; and any warranties implied during the process of use, course of dealing or course of performance.</p>
            <p>To the extent permitted by law, we do not make any representations or warrant to you that the “MEF.DEV Services” and the “MEF.DEV Platform” (a) are accurate, complete or up to date; (b) will always be available; (c) will meet your expectations; and (d) are secure or are free from errors, malfunctions, defects, viruses or malware.</p>

            <h2>Using Applications via MEF.DEV</h2>

            <p>MEF.DEV is not a provider of a specific application for use on the “MEF.DEV Platform” and is not responsible for third party Products available for use through “MEF.DEV Services” and (or) the “MEF.DEV Platform”, as well as for pricing, which we show for their use, if foreseen by the third party Product vendor.</p>
            <p>Any third party Products that you use via “MEF.DEV Services” and (or) the “MEF.DEV Platform” are provided by independent developers, software vendors, or other third parties (“Third Party Product Providers”).</p>
            <p>MEF.DEV simplifies your third-party Products usage but is not responsible for your usage of such Products. You will receive information on a specific third party Product Vendor and the terms that apply using of third party Products of a specified Vendor (“Third Party Supplier Terms”) when you start using it. You must read and acknowledge them before subscribing to any third party Products from that Vendor.</p>
            <p>Third party product Vendor’s Terms and Conditions will specify what rights you have in your relationship with the third party Product Vendor, and will describe Vendor’s liability in case you face and issues.</p>
            <p>You agree to fully comply with all applicable third party product Vendor’s Terms and Conditions. You acknowledge that violation of third party Vendor’s Terms and Conditions may result in cancellation of use, user’s and other data loss, and additional fees.</p>
            <p>If you apply the “MEF.DEV Platform” to use two or more related third party Products, but from different third party Vendors (e.g., DNS support from Provider A and hosting from Provider B), then such use may be considered as "Linked Services of Use" depending on where you are, and which consumer protection laws apply to you. If Linked Services have been created for use, you won’t have the same level of consumer protection that you would have received if you were using third party Products solely from one third party Product Vendor (where you could benefit from the using of a service package). This means that you need to rely on each Vendor separately in order to provide appropriate services, and you won’t be able to appeal the court with a complaint on the “MEF.DEV Services” and (or) the “MEF.DEV Platform”.</p>

            <h2>Limitations and Exclusions of Liability</h2>

            <p>These Terms set out the full extent of MEF.DEV’s obligations and liabilities in respect of our Services and the “MEF.DEV Platform”.</p>
